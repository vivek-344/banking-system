# Banking System

This project provides APIs for a banking system backend with the following functionalities:

## Features

1. **Bank Account Management**  
   - Create and manage bank accounts.  
   - Bank accounts consist of:
     - Ownerâ€™s Name  
     - Balance  
     - Currency  

2. **Transaction Records**  
   - Record every balance change for each account.  
   - Create an account entry record for every deposit, withdrawal, or transfer.

3. **Money Transfers**  
   - Perform money transfers between two accounts.  
   - Ensure transactional integrity: updates to both accounts occur together, or none of the updates are applied.
